# [Empathy Prompts](https://empathyprompts.net/)

Prompts to consider when making things for others to use.

This project is geared towards anyone involved with making digital products. It is my hope that this reaches both:

- People who are not necessarily involved in the day-to-day part of the process, but who help shape things like budget, timeline, and scope, and
- People who work every day to help to give these products shape and form

These prompts are intended to help build empathy, not describe any one person's experience. These prompts are <em>not</em> intended to tokenize the experience of the individuals experiencing these conditions. For further reading about disability simulations, please refer to [Job van Achterberg](https://twitter.com/detonite)'s excellent presentation, [The Imitation Game](https://noti.st/jkva/tF5o8J/slides).

## About this page

You're on [GitHub](https://github.com/), a service that helps people build digital things. Projects are called "repositories", or "repos" for short. Repositories are collections of files managed by [Git](https://git-scm.com/), software that helps people code and collaborate.

One file in this repo is called a Readme, which helps helps describe what the project is, why it was made, and how you can help out with it. GitHub takes the Readme for every repo and displays it on the repo's homepage for easier discovery.
